# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When
# using a probe to home the z-axis, it is recommended to define
# a [homing_override] section in printer.cfg to home toward the
# center of the print area.
#
#  Visual Examples:
#   rectangular bed, probe_count = 3,3:
#               x---x---x (max_point)
#               |
#               x---x---x
#                       |
#   (min_point) x---x---x
